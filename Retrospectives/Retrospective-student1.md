## Experience

This project was a good experience for working within a team. I particularly like how it was set up to value personal work
over the group work so that nobody could hold the group back. It really was refreshing to be able to do a group project without
worry of the performance of others. Even with this, my team was fantastic and was responsive to any communication. The coding was
not too difficult, as it was more or less just an extension of the last project. I think the thing that really got me thinking
was the creation of the comments page. I was a little confused on how to implement it, so we ended up creating comments pages
for each major. I didn't know if we were supposed to go this route or have 1 combined page with multiple sections in relation to each major.
Going through this, I was afraid I would break some of my teammates code and for a second, I did. The fix was relatively simple 
though, as it just included a more rigorous check when displaying the random comments on the major page. All in all, it was a 
great experience and a fun project to work on.
